<p>My research is broadly concered with avian biogeography in the Great Basin. The Great Basin is the largest desert in the contimuous United States, and is home to over 120 species of breeding birds (see a map of the Great Basin below). My research is conducted in a series of canyons that range in elevation from about 1700 - 3200 meters, where my team and I have collected data on avian occupancy and abundance, vegetation structure and phenology, and insect phenology. I am interested in understanding how breeding birds are moving in elevation throughout their breeding season, and if their breeding ranges have changed in response to climatic variables.</p>
