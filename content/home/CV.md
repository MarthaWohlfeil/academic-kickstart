**Martha Wohlfeil** is a PhD student studying Avian Ecology at the University of California Davis. She studies bird communities in the Great Basin and is interested in how different species use their landscape and make the most of the available resources. Specifically, she is studying avian movement over an elevational gradient, and examining how resouce phenology changes throughout the breeding season and over larger scales due to climate change.
