As a PhD student in Dr. Erica Fleishman's lab at UC Davis studying avian biogeography in the Great Basin, I am interested in understanding why and how birds choose different locations to live. My PhD work examines avian elevational movements across a single breeding season and across multiple years (a potential form of range shifts), as well as avian vegetational assocations across the Great Basin.
